# Hello and welcome, I'm Kyle Allen

I'm a future-focused software developer with a background in robotics and industrial automation — now diving deep into full-stack web development.

After 16+ years in automation and controls, I’m bringing that same problem-solving mindset into software. I’m currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering while building professional-grade projects to showcase what I can do.

## Featured Software Development Projects and IT Projects

- 🔹 [**Port Scanner**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/port_scanner)
  This is a basic asynchronous port scanner written in Rust using [`tokio`] and later [`future`]. This is my first self-project in Rust to better learn the programming language.
  
- 🔹 [**DevNotes App**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/devnotes-app)  
  A clean and responsive front-end note-taking tool where developers can manage notes per project, with light/dark mode support and local storage persistence. Expected to be a long term project that extends into mobile and ultimately into a stand alone application to help with a wide range of tasks. *(Built with React)*

- 🔹 [**DevLink API**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/devlink-api)  
  A backend RESTful API for storing developer profiles and projects. Uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. *(Backend-focused portfolio project)*

- 🔹 [**D280 Angular Map App**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/d280-javascript-programming-angular)  
  A completed interactive map app for WGU’s JavaScript Programming course. Built with Angular CLI and TypeScript.

- 🔹 [**System Health Checker**](https://github.com/Kyle-Allen2006/sys-health-checker)  
  A simple Python tool to monitor system health and resource usage I made for a self project to utilize Python code.
