# ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome, I'm Kyle Allen

I'm a future-focused **software developer** with a background in **robotics and industrial automation** â€” now diving deep into full-stack web development.

After 16+ years in automation and controls, Iâ€™m bringing that same **problem-solving mindset** into software. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my degree in **Software Engineering** while building professional-grade projects to showcase what I can do.

## ðŸš€ Featured Software Development Projects
