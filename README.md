# 👋 Hello and welcome, I'm Kyle Allen

I'm a future-focused **software developer** with a background in **robotics and industrial automation** — now diving deep into full-stack web development.

After 16+ years in automation and controls, I’m bringing that same **problem-solving mindset** into software. I’m currently pursuing my degree in **Software Engineering** while building professional-grade projects to showcase what I can do.

## 🚀 Featured Software Development Projects

- 🔹 [**DevNotes App**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/devnotes-app)  
  A clean and responsive front-end note-taking tool where developers can manage notes per project, with light/dark mode support and local storage persistence. Expected to be a long term project that extends into mobile and ultimately into a stand alone application to help with a wide range of tasks. *(Built with React)*

- 🔹 [**DevLink API**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/devlink-api)  
  A backend RESTful API for storing developer profiles and projects. Uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. *(Backend-focused portfolio project)*

- 🔹 [**D280 Angular Map App**](https://github.com/kyle-allen2006/d280-javascript-programming-angular)  
  A completed interactive map app for WGU’s JavaScript Programming course. Built with Angular CLI and TypeScript.
